This qmd defines the functions that we will be using for our simulation study and example implementations with our generated data from the previous scripts

Before that, we need to perform *Rubin Rules* to aggregate all important information!
This will be incorporated in these functions, as they take in the list of regression coefficients from `02` functions

# Performance Measure Functions

## `bias`

## `empirical_SE`

## `RMSE`

## `model_based_SE`

## `coverage`

## `power`

## `rel_efficiency`

# Monte Carlo Testing for sufficient simulations (N)

# `MCSE` is the function for calculating Monte Carlo Standard Error
